    "This notebook covers how to combine agents and vector stores. The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vector store and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

This means that Ruff can catch more potential issues in your code.\\n\\n2. Better compatibility with other tools: Ruff is designed to work well with other tools like Black, isort, and type checkers like Mypy. This means that you can use Ruff alongside these tools to get more comprehensive feedback on your code.\\n\\n3. Automatic fixing of lint violations: Unlike Flake8, Ruff is capable of automatically fixing its own lint violations. This can save you time and effort when fixing issues in your code.\\n\\n4. Native implementation of popular Flake8 plugins: Ruff natively implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins, which means you don't have to install and configure them separately.\\n\\n5. Customizable configuration: Ruff allows you to customize its default configuration by creating a user-specific configuration file. This gives you more control over how Ruff lints your code.\\n\\nOverall, Ruff offers a more comprehensive and customizable linting experience compared to Flake8, making it a popular choice for many developers.\"}"

    "This notebook covers how to combine agents and vector stores. The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vector store and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

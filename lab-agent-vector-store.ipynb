    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

Ruff has a larger rule set: Ruff implements over 800 rules, while Flake8 only implements around 200. This means that Ruff can catch more potential issues in your code.\\n\\n2. Ruff is faster: Ruff is written in Rust, which is a faster language than Python. This means that Ruff can lint your code more quickly than Flake8.\\n\\n3. Ruff has a built-in formatter: Ruff includes a formatter that can automatically fix some of the linting issues it finds. This can save you time and effort when cleaning up your code.\\n\\n4. Ruff is compatible with Black: Ruff's formatter is designed to be compatible with Black, another popular code formatter. This means that you can use Ruff alongside Black without any conflicts.\\n\\n5. Ruff supports newer versions of Python: Ruff can lint code for any Python version from 3.7 onwards, while Flake8 only supports up to Python 3.6.\\n\\nOverall, Ruff offers a more comprehensive and efficient linting experience compared to Flake8. However, it's worth noting that Flake8 does have some features that Ruff does not, such as support\"}"

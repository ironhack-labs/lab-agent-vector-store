NEWS RELEASE
API Outlines Path for Low-Carbon Future in New
Climate Action Framework
Industry Endorses Carbon Pricing; Supports Policies to Unleash Technology and Innovation
WASHINGTON, March 25, 2021 —- The American Petroleum Institute (API) today released a robust policy framework
of industry and government actions to address the risks of climate change while meeting the world’s long-term
energy needs. Ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), API shared analysis, initiatives and policy
solutions to build on the progress the U.S. has made in driving emissions to generational lows, including accelerating
technology and innovation; further mitigating emissions from operations; endorsing a carbon price policy; advancing
cleaner fuels and driving climate reporting.
“Confronting the challenge of climate change and building a lower-carbon future will require a combination of
government policies, industry initiatives and continuous innovation,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said.
“America has made significant progress in reducing emissions to generational lows, but there’s more work to do, and
there’s nobody better equipped to drive further progress than the people who solve some of the world’s toughest
energy problems every day. As our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies, reduce
emissions and drive transparent and consistent climate reporting, we urge lawmakers to support market-based
policies that foster innovation, including carbon pricing.”
API and its members support climate actions in the following five areas:
Accelerate Technology and Innovation to reduce emissions while meeting growing energy needs.
e Fast-tractkhe commercial deployment of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).
Confidential API_00016289

e Advance hydrogen technology, innovation and infrastructure.
e Advocate for the fullappropriations of funds for research, development and deployment (RD&D) programs
authorized in the bipartisan Energy Act of 2020.
Further Mitigate Emissions from Operations to accelerate environmental progress.
e Advance direct regulation of methane from new and existing sources.
e Develop arefinery carbon reduction program for AP! member companies.
e Deliver flaring reduction results as part of The Environmental Partnership’s flare management program.
Endorse a Carbon Price Policy to drive economy-wide, market-based solutions.
e Advocate for sensible legislation that prices carbon across all economic sectors while avoiding regulatory
duplication.
Advance Cleaner Fuels to provide lower-carbon choices for consumers.
e Develop markets for differentiated U.S. natural gas.
e Support policies to advance lower-carbon electricity.
e Reduce lifecycle emissions in the transportation sector.
Drive Climate Reporting to provide consistency and transparency.
e Expand ESG reporting guidance for the natural gas and oil industry.
e Develop a concise, minimum template of core greenhouse gas emissions indicators providing relevant
information and enhancing consistency and comparability in reporting.
e Build on API compendium of GHG emissions methodologies for the natural gas and oil industry.
Read API’s climate action framework here and a fact sheet here.
API represents all segments of America’s natural gas and oil industry, which supports more than ten million U.S. jobs
and is backed by a growing grassroots movement of millions of Americans. Our 600 members produce, process and
distribute the majority of the nation’s energy, and participate in AP! Energy Excellence, which is accelerating

Subject: House Oil & Gas Leasing Proposal Is All Cost & No Benefit
Be
The Natural Gas and Oil Industry
House Oil & Gas Leasing Proposal Is All Cost & No Benefit
Dear Friend,
As the Administration looks to foreign nations to boost energy production, the House Natural
Resources Committee’s baseline reconciliation bill proposes a double-whammy of punitive policies
to discourage U.S. energy development with new, targeted measures against the U.S. natural gas
and oil industry. That combination could lower domestic production and boomerang the U.S. back to
1970s-era dependence upon foreign energy imports.
Most concerning, instead of advancing effective solutions that build on the nation’s progress in
reducing emissions, the Committee would inundate producers with a myriad of new taxes and fees to
create a de facto natural gas and oil development ban on federal lands.
Given the Committee’s markup tomorrow, a course correction is urgent as the broader, multi-
trillion dollar reconciliation package takes shape. Read on about why the Committee’s proposal
Confidential API_00015309

could harm the environment, weaken the economy and jeopardize America’s national security.
Harm to the Environment
= Lowering U.S. production on federal lands and waters does not reduce energy demand in any
meaningful way — it just means the U.S. will have to import more natural gas and oil from countries
with less environmentally-friendly production, and transporting it to the U.S. will result in more
emissions.
e Arecent study from energy analytics firm OnLocation projects that a reduction in natural gas
production from U.S. leases would lead to an increase in emissions for power generation due
to a reversion to coal use for power generation.
e The World Bank’s April 2021 Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report shows that the U.S. reduced
gas flaring by 32% from 2019 to 2020 and the U.S. has one of the l owest flaring intensities
when compared to its producing peers — like Russia — around the world.
Harm to the Economy
=> In 2019, this industry supported nearly 8% or $1.7 trillion (PWC Study July 2021) of the U.S. GDP,
generating over $100 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue each year— which goes to
important programs like education, infrastructure and conservation across all 50 states.
e Workers who explore for and produce oil and natural gas earn significantly more than their
state’s average salary in nearly each of the top oil and natural gas producing states. Mostjobs
associated with solar and wind energy pay far less than the average salary of upstream
natural gas and oil workers.
Harm to National Security
= Restricting development on federal lands and waters is nothing more than an “import more oil”
policy. Energy demand will continue to rise—especially as the economy recovers—and we will be
forced to rely on oil produced outside the U.S. to fill the gap. Such reliance places the U.S. at the
mercy of foreign countries — often adversaries such as Russia.
Scroll down for detailed information and specific reasons why the House Natural Resources
Committee bill would disincentivize federal lease bidding, impose huge new costs on production,
exclude huge areas of rich natural resources and increase pipeline transportation costs.
Sincerely,
Lem Smith
API Vice President — Federal Relations
Some of the Punitive Measures in the House Proposal
1. Disincentivizing Federal Lease Bidding
e 500% Minimum Bid Increase: Would raise onshore minimum lease bid from $2/acre to
$10/acre. By BLM office 2020 sales, 11% of leases sold in New Mexico were below $10/acre;
78% in Colorado; and 30% in North Dakota.
e Cuts Time to Produce in Half: Would reduce the primary term for new onshore leases from
10 years to 5 years, even though a significant percentage of leases require more than 5 years
to start producing. For example, recent data shows that 37% of leases in New Mexico started
production more than 5 years after authorization.
e More Than Doubles Annual Rent: Would raise annual rental rates to $3/acre for the first 2
years, and then $5/acre, increasing costs by at least $123 million per year.
e Eliminates Possibility of Royalty Relief: Would eliminate authority to grant royalty relief in
difficult times or national emergency.
e Imposes New Inspection Fee: Would raise the minimum inspection fees each operator will
pay annually to anywhere from $800-$11,300 per lease, varying by lease.
Confidential API_00015310

2. Imposing Huge New Costs on Production
e Increased Royalty Rates: Would raise onshore royalty rate floor by more than half from
12.5% to 20% on new leases and would raise the already high offshore royalty rate floor to
20%.
e New Royalties on Venting/Flaring: Would require royalties to be paid on all gas produced,
including gas used or consumed for the benefit of the lease such as gathering compressors
and gas that is consumed or lost by venting, flaring, or fugitive releases, with limited
exceptions, which would raise royalty payments on average by 6.5%.
e 1500-2000% Bonding Increase: Would increase onshore federal lease bond minimum by
15X for a federal lease bond, by 20X for a statewide bond, and removes the nationwide bond
option. Additionally, it calls for rulemaking that will require bonding to cover 100% of the
reclamation costs of a lease on federal lands that have less than 0.05% of federal wells
orphaned.
e New Expression of Interest Fee: Would impose a minimum $15/acre to notify the
government of public interest in leasing. Onshore leases can be as large as 2,560 acres, thus
costing up to $38,400/lease.
e New “Resource” Fee: Would impose a $4/acre annual fee on producing leases, thus costing
up to $10,240/lease for onshore leases, and $23,040/lease for offshore leases.
e New Leasing Fee: Would impose a $6/acre annual fee on non-producing leases, thus
costing up to $15,360 for each onshore lease, and $34,560 for each offshore lease.
e New Severance Tax Fee: Would impose a new annual, non-refundable Federal severance
fee “tax” on every barrel of oil equivalent produced from new leases on federal lands and
waters.
e New Idled Wells Fee: Would impose an annual cost anywhere from $500-$7,500 per idled
well per year, and would deem a well “nonoperational” after 2 years, down from 7 years.
3. Excluding Huge Areas of Rich Natural Resources: Several measures would severely limit
access to federal natural gas and oil development — including terminating some existing leases — in
Alaska (ANWR/NPRA) and the Gulf of Mexico (Eastern Planning Area), which would hurt local
communities that use this royalty revenue for conservation, education, and infrastructure.
4. Increasing Pipeline Transportation Costs: Would impose a new $10,000/mile annual fee for
water depths greater than 500 ft.; and $1,000/mile for water depths less than 500 ft. There are
approximately 26 thousand miles of pipelines in the offshore with about 12.6k miles in waters less
than 400 ft and 13.7k miles in waters greater than 400 ft. Increased annual costs would total ~$149
million.

_ NEWS RELEASE
API Outlines Path for Low-Carbon Future in New
Climate Action Framework
Industry Endorses Carbon Pricing; Supports Policies to Unleash Technology and Innovation
WASHINGTON, March 25, 2021 —- The American Petroleum Institute (API) today released a robust policy framework of
industry and government actions to address the risks of climate change while meeting the world’s long-term energy needs.
Ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), API shared analysis, initiatives and policy solutions to build on the
progress the U.S. has made in driving emissions to generational lows, including accelerating technology and innovation;
further mitigating emissions from operations; endorsing a carbon price policy; advancing cleaner fuels and driving climate
reporting.
“Confronting the challenge of climate change and building a lower-carbon future will require a combination of government
policies, industry initiatives and continuous innovation,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said. “America has made
significant progress in reducing emissions to generational lows, but there’s more work to do, and there’s nobody better
equipped to drive further progress than the people who solve some of the world’s toughest energy problems every day. As
our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies, reduce emissions and drive transparent and
consistent climate reporting, we urge lawmakers to support market-based policies that foster innovation, including carbon
pricing.”
API and its members support climate actions in the following five areas:
Confidential API_00016170

Accelerate Technology and Innovation to reduce emissions while meeting growing energy needs.
e Fast-track the commercial deployment of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).
e Advance hydrogen technology, innovation and infrastructure.
e Advocate for the full appropriations of funds for research, development and deployment (RD&D) programs
authorized in the bipartisan Energy Act of 2020.
Further Mitigate Emissions from Operations to accelerate environmental progress.
e Advance direct regulation of methane from new and existing sources.
e Develop a refinery carbon reduction program for API member companies.
e Deliver flaring reduction results as part of The Environmental Partnership’s flare management program.
Endorse a Carbon Price Policy to drive economy-wide, market-based solutions.
e Advocate for sensible legislation that prices carbon across all economic sectors while avoiding regulatory
duplication.
Advance Cleaner Fuels to provide lower-carbon choices for consumers.
e Develop markets for differentiated U.S. natural gas.
e Support policies to advance lower-carbon electricity.
e Reduce lifecycle emissions in the transportation sector.
Drive Climate Reporting to provide consistency and transparency.
e Expand ESG reporting guidance for the natural gas and oil industry.
e Develop a concise, minimum template of core greenhouse gas emissions indicators providing relevant information
and enhancing consistency and comparability in reporting.
e Build on API compendium of GHG emissions methodologies for the natural gas and oil industry.
Read API’s climate action framework here and a fact sheet here.
API represents all segments of America’s natural gas and oil industry, which supports more than ten million U.S. jobs and is
backed by a growing grassroots movement of millions of Americans. Our 600 members produce, process and distribute the
majority of the nation’s energy, and participate in AP! Energy Excellence, whichis accelerating environmental and safety
progress by fostering new technologies and transparent reporting. API was formed in 1919 as a standards-setting
organization and has developed more than 700 standards to enhance operational and environmental safety, efficiency and
sustainability.

solutions to build on the progress the U.S. has made in driving emissions to generational lows, including accelerating
technology and innovation; further mitigating emissions from operations; endorsing a carbon price policy; advancing
cleaner fuels and driving climate reporting.
“Confronting the challenge of climate change and building a lower-carbon future will require a combination of
government policies, industry initiatives and continuous innovation,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said.
“America has made significant progress in reducing emissions to generational lows, but there’s more work to do, and
there’s nobody better equipped to drive further progress than the people who solve some of the world’s toughest
energy problems every day. As our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies, reduce
emissions and drive transparent and consistent climate reporting, we urge lawmakers to support market-based

The Honorable Paul D. Ryan The Honorable Nancy Pelosi
Speaker Democratic Leader U.S. House of Representatives
U.S. House of Representatives H-204, The Capitol
H-232, The Capitol Washington, DC 20515
Washington, DC 20515
Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi:
The American Petroleum Institute (API) strongly supports the House amendment to S.
2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act. In particular, the amendment includes
provisions that will require the Department of Energy to consider liquefied natural gas
(LNG) exports permit applications in a timely manner, ensure natural gas pipelines are
permitted more efficiently, and foster necessary collaboration among federal and state
governments, educational institutions, industry, and labor to encourage and promote
workforce training and diversity in the energy and manufacturing sector.
The House amendment provides a streamlined process for LNG exports projects before
the Department of Energy which will accelerate America’s rise as a world-class exporter
of natural gas, create U.S. jobs, grow our economy, and significantly strengthen the global
energy market. And expediting the free trade of natural gas from America will help
enhance our national security interests and bolster our global allies’ independence from
nations that would use their energy resources as a diplomatic and economic weapon.
Technological breakthroughs in the oil and natural gas industry have unleashed an energy
renaissance, establishing the United States as the world’s largest natural gas producer. We
have enough natural gas to supply affordable energy domestically and significantly
increase U.S. participation in the global market for LNG. The LNG exports provisions
provide the Department of Energy with a meaningful deadline to make decisions on
pending applications that have already completed the extensive environmental review
process. Establishing greater certainty in the LNG exports permitting process will
Confidential API_00035175

accelerate investment in the U.S. economy and strengthen our strategic alliances abroad.
Since 2005, natural gas production in the United States has increased by over 50 percent,
and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects a 55 percent increase in total
natural gas production from 2015 to 2040. In addition, study after study concludes that
expanding our export opportunities will create jobs, strengthen our economy, and enhance
our national and energy security. And independent reports show exporting U.S. LNG will
reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
As the number one natural gas producer in the world, we also need safe, reliable
infrastructure in place to realize our true energy potential and provide consumers with the
energy they need. Pipelines continue to be one of the safest and most efficient modes to
transport product. The House amendment recognizes the importance of building
infrastructure efficiently by streamlining the permitting process and setting realistic
deadlines for approval.
The House amendment also provides the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to
approve rights-of-way and issue permits for natural gas pipelines on National Park
Service lands. The Secretary already has this authority on other federal lands, and thus,
the provision will provide consistency to the federal lands permitting process. The House
amendment also provides the Secretary with the authority to designate 10 National
Energy Security Corridors through federal lands. Previously, the Energy Policy Act of
2005 gave the Department of Interior the ability to designate National Energy Security
Corridors in the 11 contiguous Western states, and the corridor designation doesn’t
change the NEPA process currently required for building a pipeline.
In addition, the 21°‘ century energy renaissance has created unprecedented opportunities
for Americans of all backgrounds. This potential is outlined in a study conducted by IHS
entitled “Minority and Female Employment in the Oil and Natural Gas and Petrochemical
Industries.” The study estimates that nearly 1.9 million job opportunities could be created
through 2035 in America’s oil, natural gas and petrochemicals industries. These are good-
paying careers that pay an average of nearly $50,000 higher than the U.S. average. The
report estimates there are nearly 707,000 job opportunities projected to be filled by
African American and Hispanic workers, and 290,000 projected to be filled by women.
Expansion of education and workforce training programs will help ensure competitive
access to job opportunities. The House amendment promotes the education and
workforce training needed to ensure that underrepresented communities can secure a
growing number of new opportunities in the energy sector, and we strongly support this
effort.
API strongly urges the U.S. House of Representatives to approve the House amendment
to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act.
Sincerely,
Ld
Jack N. Gerard

Subject: House Oil & Gas Leasing Proposal Is All Cost & No Benefit
[Xls,
Confidential API_00015313

The Natural Gas and Oil Industry
House Oil & Gas Leasing Proposal Is All Cost & No Benefit
Dear Friend,
As the Administration looks to foreign nations to boost energy production, the House Natural
Resources Committee’s baseline reconciliation bill proposes a double-whammy of punitive policies
to discourage U.S. en ergy development with new, targeted measures against the U.S. natural gas
and oil industry. That combination could lower domestic production and boomerang the U.S. back to
1970s-era dependence upon foreign energy imports.
Most concerning, instead of advancing effective solutions that build on the nation’s progress in
reducing emissions, the Committee would inundate producers with a myriad of new taxes and fees to
create a de facto natural gas and oil deve lopment ban on federal lands.
Given the Committee’s markup tomorrow, a course correction is urgent as the broader, multi-
trillion dollar reconciliation package takes shape. Read on about why the Committee’s proposal
could harm the environment, weaken the economy and jeopardize America’s national security.
Harm to the Environment
=> Lowering U.S. production on federal lands and waters does not reduce energy demand in any
meaningful way — it just means the U.S. will have to import more natural gas and oil from countries
with less environmentally-friendly production, and transporting it to the U.S. will result in more
emissions.
e Arecent study from energy analytics firm OnLocation projects that a reduction in natural gas
production from U.S. leases would lead to an increase in emissions for power generation due
to a reversion to coal use for power generation.
@ The World Bank’s April 2021 Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report shows that the U.S. reduced
gas flaring by 32% from 2019 to 2020 and the U.S. has one of the l owest flaring intensities
when compared to its producing peer s —like Russia — around the world.
Harm to the Economy
= In 2019, this industry supported nearly 8% or $1.7 trillion ( PWC Study July 2021) of the U.S. GDP,
generating over $100 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue each year — which goes to
important programs like education, infrastructure and conservation across all 50 states.
@ Workers who explore for and produce oil and natural gas earn significantly more than their
state’s average salary in nearly each of the top oil and natural gas producing states. Most jobs
associated with solar and wind energy pay far less than the average salary of upstream natural
gas and oil workers.
Harm to National Security
= Restricting development on federal lands and waters is nothing more than an “import more oil”
policy. Energy demand will continue to rise—especially as the economy recovers—and we will be
f orced to rely on oil produced outside the U.S. to fill the gap. Such reliance places the U.S. at the
mercy of foreign countries — often adversaries such as Russia.

Scroll down for detailed information and specific reasons why the House Natural Resources
Committee bill would disincentivize federal lease bidding, impose huge new costs on production,
exclude huge areas of rich natural resources and increase pipeline transportation costs.
Sincerely,
Lem Smith
API Vice President — Federal Relations
Some of the Punitive Measures in the House Proposal
1. Disincentivizing Federal Lease Bidding
® 500% Minimum Bid Increase: Would raise onshore minimum lease bid from $2/acre to
$10/acre. By BLM office 2020 sales, 11% of leases sold in New Mexico were below $10/acre;
78% in Colorado; and 30% in North Dakota.
@ Cuts Time to Produce in Half: Would reduce the primary term for new onshore leases from
10 years to 5 years, even though a significant percentage of leases require more than 5 years
to start producing. For example, recent data shows that 37% of leases in New Mexico started
production more than 5 years after authorization.
® More Than Doubles Annual Rent: Would raise annual rental rates to $3/acre for the first 2
years, and then $5/acre, increasing costs by at least $123 million per year.
e Eliminates Possibility of Royalty Relief: Would eliminate authority to grant royalty relief in
difficult times or national emergency.
e Imposes New Inspection Fee: Would raise the minimum inspection fees each operator will
pay annually to anywhere from $800-$11,300 per lease, varying by lease.
2. Imposing Huge New Costs on Production
e Increased Royalty Rates: Would raise onshore royalty rate floor by more than half from
12.5% to 20% on new leases and would raise the already high offshore royalty rate floor to
20%.
@ New Royalties on Venting/Flaring: Would require royalties to be paid on all gas produced,
including gas used or consumed for the benefit of the lease such as gathering compressors
and gas that is consumed or lost by venting, flaring, or fugitive releases, with limited
exceptions, which would raise royalty payments on average by 6.5%.
® 1500-2000% Bonding Increase: Would increase onshore federal lease bond minimum by
15X for a federal lease bond, by 20X for a statewide bond, and removes the nationwide bond
option. Additionally, it calls for rulemaking that will require bonding to cover 100% of the
reclamation costs of a lease on federal lands that have less than 0.05% of federal wells
orphaned.
e New Expression of Interest Fee: Would impose a minimum $15/acre to notify the
government of public interest in leasing. Onshore leases can be as large as 2,560 acres, thus
costing up to $38,400/lease.
® New “Resource” Fee: Would impose a $4/acre annual fee on producing leases, thus costing
up to $10,240/lease for onshore leases, and $23,040/lease for offshore leases.
® New Leasing Fee: Would impose a $6/acre annual fee on non-producing leases, thus
costing up to $15,360 for each onshore lease, and $34,560 for each offshore lease.
@ New Severance Tax Fee: Would impose a new annual, non-refundable Federal severance
fee “tax” on every barrel of oil equivalent produced from new leases on federal lands and
waters.
® New Idled Wells Fee: Would impose an annual cost anywhere from $500-$7,500 per idled
well per year, and would deem a well “nonoperational” after 2 years, down from 7 years.
Confidential API_00015315

3. Excluding Huge Areas of Rich Natural Resources: Several measures would severely limit
access to federal natural gas and oil development — including terminating some existing leases — in
Alaska (ANWR/NPRA) and the Gulf of Mexico (Eastern Planning Area), which would hurt local
communities that use this royalty revenue for conservation, education, and infrastructure.
4. Increasing Pipeline Transportation Costs: Would impose a new $10,000/mile annual fee for
water depths greater than 500 ft.; and $1,000/mile for water depths less than 500 ft. There are
approximately 26 thousand miles of pipelines in the offshore with about 12.6k miles in waters less
than 400 ft and 13.7k miles in waters greater than 400 ft. Increased annual costs would total ~$149
million.

5 NEWS RELEASE
API Outlines Path for Low-Carbon Future in New
Climate Action Framework
Industry Endorses Carbon Pricing; Supports Policies to Unleash Technology and Innovation
WASHINGTON, March 25, 2021 - The American Petroleum Institute (API) today released a robust policy framework of
industry and government actions to address the risks of climate change while meeting the world’s long-term energy needs.
Ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), API shared analysis, initiatives and policy solutions to build on the
progress the U.S. has made in driving emissions to generational lows, including accelerating technology and innovation;
further mitigating emissions from operations; endorsing a carbon price policy; advancing cleaner fuels and driving climate
reporting.
“Confronting the challenge of climate change and building a lower-carbon future will require a combination of government
policies, industry initiatives and continuous innovation,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said. “America has made
significant progress in reducing emissions to generational lows, but there’s more work to do, and there’s nobody better
equipped to drive further progress than the people who solve some of the world’s toughest energy problems every day. As
our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies, reduce emissions and drive transparent and
consistent climate reporting, we urge lawmakers to support market-based policies that foster innovation, including carbon
pricing.”
API and its members support climate actions in the following five areas:
Accelerate Technology and Innovation to reduce emissions while meeting growing energy needs.
e Fast-track the commercial deployment of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).
e Advance hydrogen technology, innovation and infrastructure.
e Advocate for the full appropriations of funds for research, development and deployment (RD&D) programs
authorized in the bipartisan Energy Act of 2020.
Further Mitigate Emissions from Operations to accelerate environmental progress.
e Advance direct regulation of methane from new and existing sources.
Confidential API_00016182

e Develop arefinery carbon reduction program for AP! member companies.
e Deliver flaring reduction results as part of The Environmental Partnership’s flare management program.
Endorse a Carbon Price Policy to drive economy-wide, market-based solutions.
e Advocate for sensible legislation that prices carbon across all economic sectors while avoiding regulatory
duplication.
Advance Cleaner Fuels to provide lower-carbon choices for consumers.
e Develop markets for differentiated U.S. natural gas.
e Support policies to advance lower-carbon electricity.
e Reduce lifecycle emissions in the transportation sector.
Drive Climate Reporting to provide consistency and transparency.
e Expand ESG reporting guidance for the natural gas and oil industry.
e Develop a concise, minimum template of core greenhouse gas emissions indicators providing relevant information
and enhancing consistency and comparability in reporting.
e Build on API compendium of GHG emissions methodologies for the natural gas and oil industry.

NEWS RELEASE
API Outlines Path for Low-Carbon Future in New
Climate Action Framework
Industry Endorses Carbon Pricing; Supports Policies to Unleash Technology and Innovation
WASHINGTON, March 25, 2021 - The American Petroleum Institute (API) today released a robust policy framework of
industry and government actions to address the risks of climate change while meeting the world’s long-term energy needs.
Ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), API shared analysis, initiatives and policy solutions to build on the
progress the U.S. has made in driving emissions to generational lows, including accelerating technology and innovation;
further mitigating emissions from operations; endorsing a carbon price policy; advancing cleaner fuels and driving climate
reporting.
“Confronting the challenge of climate change and building a lower-carbon future will require a combination of government
Confidential API_00016130

policies, industry initiatives and continuous innovation,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said. “America has made
significant progress in reducing emissions to generational lows, but there’s more work to do, and there’s nobody better
equipped to drive further progress than the people who solve some of the world’s toughest energy problems every day. As
our industry accelerates efforts to advance groundbreaking technologies, reduce emissions and drive transparent and
consistent climate reporting, we urge lawmakers to support market-based policies that foster innovation, including carbon
pricing.”
API and its members support climate actions in the following five areas:
Accelerate Technology and Innovation to reduce emissions while meeting growing energy needs.
e Fast-track the commercial deployment of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).
e Advance hydrogen technology, innovation and infrastructure.

authorized in the bipartisan Energy Act of 2020.
Further Mitigate Emissions from Operations to accelerate environmental progress.
e Advance direct regulation of methane from new and existing sources.
e Develop arefinery carbon reduction program for AP! member companies.
e Deliver flaring reduction results as part of The Environmental Partnership’s flare management program.
Endorse a Carbon Price Policy to drive economy-wide, market-based solutions.
e Advocate for sensible legislation that prices carbon across all economic sectors while avoiding regulatory
duplication.
Advance Cleaner Fuels to provide lower-carbon choices for consumers.
e Develop markets for differentiated U.S. natural gas.
e Support policies to advance lower-carbon electricity.
e Reduce lifecycle emissions in the transportation sector.
Drive Climate Reporting to provide consistency and transparency.
e Expand ESG reporting guidance for the natural gas and oil industry.
e Develop a concise, minimum template of core greenhouse gas emissions indicators providing relevant information
and enhancing consistency and comparability in reporting.
e Build on API compendium of GHG emissions methodologies for the natural gas and oil industry.
Read API’s climate action framework here and a fact sheet here.
API represents all segments of America’s natural gas and oil industry, which supports more than ten million U.S. jobs and is
backed by a growing grassroots movement of millions of Americans. Our 600 members produce, process and distribute the
majority of the nation’s energy, and participate in AP/ Energy Excellence, whichis accelerating environmental and safety
progress by fostering new technologies and transparent reporting. API was formed in 1919 as a standards-setting

Shannon and Veena,
For your awareness, there is ademonstration scheduled to occur at the U.S. Capitol at 4 pm today by the group Peoples Watch
in support of the Green New Deal. Both the Sunrise Movement and ShutDown DC are involved in the demonstration and have
been in the area of the Capitol for most of the day.
While this demonstration has not mentioned or shown any interest toward API, it is believed that the Thursday, September
27th, House vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill could impact further spontaneous rallies and
demonstrations, which according to Sunrise Movement is a "huge legislative week for climate, workers rights,
and so much more."
Mentions about fossil fuel companies were found on several social media pages. However, no direct mention
of API was detected while using our specific search terms. ShutDownDC also continues to mention the
organized demonstration for Oct.11-15th.
We will continue to monitor these events and pass the information along for your awareness. As always, we will
contact you if there is any concerning or threatening content related to API.
If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know.
Allthe best,

Team:
During this period, the conversation on social media was dominated by discussion of winter weather a nd attributions to
climate change. This was largely driven by the snowstorm that swept across the Southern U.S. late last week and through
the weekend, with a popular narrative on Twitter combatting the idea that this was a "Christmas miracle" and instead
blaming climate change for the weather. There was some additional conversation around the continued wildfires in
California, including an article in the New York Times alleging that these fires will be the new normal for the area.
Additionally, during this reporting period, we saw some discussion arise around protests and pushback against Keystone
XL. This includes a group of environmental protesters who interrupted the “Wells Fargo Investment Thought Leadership
Keystone XL, joining with other environmental groups in asking President Trump to change the proposed route of the
pipeline to protect the environment. Additionally, we saw traction behind a petition nearly 15,000 strong from people
declaring they will stand with the Paris Agreement.

With help from Anthony Adragna, Annie Snider, Eric Wolff and Alex Guillén
RIDE-ALONG: Though House Republicans say they continue to be satisfied with the pace of the
Trump administration's deregulatory efforts, GOP leaders have teed up votes this week to block several
Obama-era environmental rules — ranging from the Chesapeake Bay cleanup to Endangered Species Act
listings — in hopes of securing support for their next spending bill from the conservative right flank of
the party. The Obama-era riders were made in order this week to the pending "minibus" package H.R.
6147 (115) for which recorded amendment votes are expected today and a vote likely Thursday.
GOP Rep. Ken Calvert, who chairs the subcommittee that authored the Interior-EPA spending bill
included in the minibus, said the riders are simply an "insurance" policy to make sure the administration
completes work on GOP priorities, Pro's Anthony Adragna reports. But the approach could backfire
when it comes to conference with the Senate, where the chamber has tried to tamp down on any
controversial policy riders. "We've tried for the most part thus far to keep riders and authorizing
legislation and poison pills, whatever you want to call them, off these bills," Senate Appropriations
Chairman Richard Shelby said. "That's what we'd like to stay with."
Democrats and Republicans alike say most of the policy riders aren't likely to become law since bills
ultimately need 60 votes for passage in the Senate, but multiple House GOP lawmakers said they thought
adding them would give their chamber a better hand going into negotiations with the Senate. Still, some
in the House say the effort showed a fundamental disrespect of the appropriations process. "I'm a
disciplined appropriator who believes we should not have authorizing language on an appropriations bill,
"Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur told reporters. "It is a terrible way to legislate." Read the full story.
NEXT STOP: Senate GOP leaders are eyeing a floor vote next week on its spending package to fund an
array of domestic agencies, including the Interior- Environment title, a source familiar with the plan told
Pro's Sarah Ferris. The Senate bill would be broader than the House minibus on the floor this week.
Senate Republicans are in talks to bring up a four-bill spending bundle that would include the
Transportation- HUD S. 3023 (115), Agriculture S. 2976 (115), Financial Services and Interior-

RFS, THE NEXT CHAPTER: EPA officials will be in Michigan this morning to hear ethanol and oil
supporters duke it out over its proposed biofuel volume obligations under the Renewable Fuel Standard.
The agency made a modest increase to the requirements for advanced biofuels, but it backed down at the
last minute on a provision that would have shifted the mandate from small refiners with economic
hardship exemptions to large refiners. A public hearing on the RFS proposal kicks off at 9 a.m. in
Ypsilanti, Mich., featuring voices from both sides of the RFS debate divided into 10 panels, according to
a draft schedule shared with ME.
Patrick Kelly, senior fuels policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute — no fan of the
biofuels program — will urge EPA not to exceed 9.7 percent ethanol in the gasoline pool for 2019. "The
increases in gasoline demand projected at the inception of the RFS in 2007 did not materialize, nor did the
commercialization of cellulosic biofuels," he says in his prepared testimony, urging the use of EPA's
exemption authority. On the other side, Samantha Slater of the Renewable Fuels Association is slated to
say EPA's proposal "means nothing" until it reallocates lost gallons under its waivers. And National
Wildlife Federation's Mare Smith will call out "the negative impacts the production of these fuels has on
water quality, land use, wildlife habitat, and air emissions" in his testimony. If you want to listen in to
today's hearing, EPA is providing a "listen only" teleconference line here.
OPPOSITION IN FULL DISPLAY: Dozens of speakers from medical and environmental groups
turned up Tuesday for a public hearing to oppose EPA's proposal to bar science that doesn't have publicly
available data, outnumbering those who support the policy, Pro's Emily Holden reports. They argued
EPA's policy would make it impossible or incredibly expensive to conduct research needed for writing
regulations. And they drew on the tobacco industry's playbook surrounding secondhand smoke.
"In short, we believe this policy is not in the best interest of our profession, the patients that we serve or
the public health," said Meredith McCormack, a physician-scientist with the American Thoracic Society.
"The focus on transparency is highly reminiscent of the rhetoric used by the tobacco players decades ago.
"Three Democratic lawmakers appeared at the hearing, including Rep. Paul Tonko of New York who
called out the policy's transparency. "This is not about protecting human health or our environment. This
emperor has no clothes," he said. Read more.
WHEELER'S FIRST RULE: EPA finalized a rule Tuesday that directs how the toxic waste produced
from 400 coal-fired power plants is stored across the U.S., according to The Washington Post. It is the
first major rule signed by acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler since he took over for Scott Pruitt.
The rule says existing ash ponds can stick around until October 2020, an extension from April 2019. It
would also provide more flexibility to states in certifying whether utilities’ facilities meet standards, as
well as in suspending groundwater monitoring in certain cases, the Post reports. The rule is expected to
save the industry between $28 million and $31 million a year in compliance costs, officials told the Post.
Confidential API_00102551

Under Pruitt, EPA first proposed changes in March to the 2015 rule, after industry petitioned the Trump
administration. EPA did not return questions from POLITICO and did not post a copy of the rule. Read
the story.
DRILLING DOWN: They may have come up short in getting their amendments considered as part of
the Interior-EPA floor fight, but opponents of offshore drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico are already
eyeing their next opportunity: the NDAA conference. "I'm going to keep coming at them like a rabid dog
to get offshore drilling banned in the Eastern Gulf," Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) told reporters. He said
opponents of offshore drilling were "pretty set in" their op posi tion but willing to listen to potential
compromises. "At the end of the day, getting the most protections we can for the people of Florida is the
main thing," he said.
WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP? Top Senate Energy leaders Lisa Murkowski and Maria Cantwell are
pushing to add an amendment related to the Bureau of Reclamation to the pending water resources
package, S. 2800 (115), according to EPW ranking member Tom Carper. "If it were actually folded into
our bill — and I don't know that it would be — it would comprise about 25 percent of our bill," Carper
told reporters, adding he'd have to look at the final version before pledging his support. EPW Chairman
John Barrasso's office confirmed the effort and said he backs the amendment. Neither Cantwell's nor
Murkowski's office responded to requests for comment.
FOIA WHAT IT'S WORTH: EPA chief of staff Ryan Jackson told Pro's Eric Wolff the agency hopes
to clear a backlog of FOIA requests from the administrator's office "within the next few months,"
following outcry over unanswered requests that grew under Pruitt, leading watchdog groups and news
organizations to file lawsuits accusing the agency of flouting the law. "I believe that we have an
organization in place now that will be able to response to these and get the FOIA requests answered, get
FOIA lawsuits settled and completed we hope," Jackson said. Read more.
AND SOIT GOES: The National Archives and Records Administration is looking into whether EPA
scrubbed calendar records under Pruitt, in light of a recent CNN report that detailed how meetings and
appointments on Pruitt's official calendar were altered or removed. Laurence Brewer, the chief records
officer for the U.S. Government, sent a letter to EPA's record official, John Ellis, requesting that the
agency detail how it will address the allegations in 30 days.
NICHOLS MEETS WHEELER: California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols met with
Wheeler Tuesday, but the two discussed nothing of substance, according to CARB spokesman Stanley
Young. Nichols had said earlier in the day that she'd never met Wheeler but didn't expect much change in
policy from his predecessor. California and EPA are locked in a fight over the stringency of fuel economy
standards, a battle that seems destined to end up in court. But today's meeting was "cordial," Young said.
FRIEND OR FOE? President Donald Trump will host European Commission President Jean-Claude
Juncker at the White House on July 25 for talks on a "wide range of priorities," including energy security,
the White House confirmed. Trump recently called the EU a "foe" of the United States during a CBS
News interview. But the president has also focused his attention on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline,
reiterating at his Russia summit in Helsinki this week that the pipeline —- a collaboration between
Germany and the Kremlin — would emerge as a competitor to the U.S.
About that: Barrasso, who was appointed this week to the Senate's NATO Observer Group, said he
would introduce legislation today "to make it easier for our NATO allies to work with us, with the
abundance of natural gas that we have that they can buy from us." The legislation, he said during
Tuesday's leadership press conference, will try to do two things: make mandatory sanctions against those
involved with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline related to Russia, and make it easier for NATO and the United
States to work together on a transatlantic energy alliance. Read a summary of the legislation here.

Poison pills banished from Senate spending bills Back
By Sarah Ferris | 06/15/2018 12:39 PM EDT
The Senate this year has abandoned the perennial brawls over policy riders that uprooted its regular
spending process for nearly a decade, aiming to avoid another paralyzing funding fight this fall.
In a pact that's gone largely unnoticed on Capitol Hill, senators of both parties have so far crafted bills
that are virtually free of so-called poison pill riders that usually entangle the annual spending bills. The
motivation for the Senate's uncommonly bipartisan process is the threat of a government shutdown just
weeks before the midterm elections.
The powerful Senate Appropriations Committee 1s now more than halfway done with its work for the
year, without a single fight over immigration, the Second Amendment or Obama-era environmental rules.
The newfound accord is a show of bargaining, not brinkmanship. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the lead
negotiator for Democrats, heralded the development as a return to "old school" appropriations work.
"For those who are new to this, it's no small accomplishment," Leahy said Thursday. "We avoided new
poison pill riders, from either the left or the right."
The tidal shift is the result of an unlikely partnership between GOP spending chief Richard Shelby (R-
Ala.) and Leahy. It has brought hope that the Senate can finally end its yearslong drought of individual
funding bills on the floor, halting the cycle of shutdowns and trillion-dollar spending bills approved in the
Confidential API_00102554

dead of night.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has coasted through seven bills in just four weeks, with plans to
complete all 12 by July. Each has been approved overwhelmingly, and most unanimously.
Instead of turning markups into high-voltage matchups, the first-term chairman and Leahy have resolved
to work out matters privately. Both parties have agreed to hold their noses to vote for a bill that they
consider imperfect, but good enough.
"More important than the pace of this process is the bipartisanship that has defined it here," Shelby told
appropriators at Thursday's markup, lauding both parties from "refraining" from extraneous political
fights.
"The most appropriate place for that debate is the relevant authorizing committee, not the Appropriations
Committee," Shelby said.
The Senate's stack of finished bills includes one with a notorious track record for poison pill riders: The
measure that funds the EPA.
That Interior-Environment bill was tripped up by partisan riders during the entire span of former
President Barack Obama's tenure, and it hasn't reached the Senate floor since 2009.
This year, despite mounting crises at the EPA, the bill sailed out of committee on a 31-0 vote on
Thursday.
"I have said we need to return to regular order around here," said a jubilant Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-
Alaska), chairwoman of the subcommittee that handles the bill.
Another long-serving Republican on that subcommittee, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said he was
astonished the bill was approved so easily.
"You've been able to take probably the most difficult set of issues of any subcommittees and work out a
consensus," Alexander said. "That's what the Senate should do, and I congratulate you for that."
The smooth path for spending bills in the Senate — at least in committee — couldn't look more different
in the House.
In the House bills, for example, Republicans have drafted language to allow firearms on Army Corps of
Engineers land, repeal the Waters of the United States rule and block funding for high-speed rail in
California.
Another provision would allow a government- funded ad campaign to promote GMO products, which
was left out of the Senate's bill.
"They've loaded it down with riders just like before, and that's not acceptable," said Rep. David Price of
North Carolina, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations transportation and infrastructure panel.
The Senate is working to reduce conflicts after President Donald Trump declared this year that he
wouldn't sign another massive omnibus, in which congressional leaders bundle all 12 spending bills into
one must-pass package. The most recent omnibus topped out at over 2,200 pages, and was approved just
hours after it was released.
That unsavory process triggered a last-minute veto threat from Trump, giving lawmakers whiplash on
Capitol Hill after Trump's own advisers had helped shape it.
Confidential API_00102555

"If we're going to avoid another omnibus, and instead pass individual spending bills and send them to the
president's desk, we have to work in a bipartisan fashion, which I'm going to try hard to do," Shelby
declared to his fellow appropriators last month.
Shelby and Leahy spent months scheming behind closed doors with fellow appropriators and party
leadership on a way to end the Senate's appropriations stalemate on the floor.
Since 2009, very few spending bills have passed the Senate at all, let alone on time. Most of those were
sweetened with a must-pass government funding extension or a side of emergency cash.
The Senate last approved an individual spending bill in 2016, when it cleared $1.1 billion for the Zika
virus attached to an unrelated Military Construction-VA bill.
The Senate's work this year has been made possible by a massive budget deal that delivered a huge cash
infusion for domestic programs. Under the deal, domestic spending explodes by $78 billion over just two
years.
With billions more to spend, it defused the usual partisan bickering over where that money would go.
But Senate Republicans did take some stances on funding issues that put them at odds with their House
counterparts.
The Senate, for instance, increases spending on nuclear nonproliferation, while the House cuts nearly $1
billion compared with last year. The Senate also doesn't touch funding for contentious projects like
California high-speed railways and hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest, which the House would
block.
The Senate's agriculture bill includes a generous budget for an international food aid program, Food for
Peace, that Trump sought to cut. House Republicans, meanwhile, cut about $200 million from the
program.
In the Senate's environmental bill, Murkowski struck what she called "a common sense approach" to
funding the EPA.
That bill does include ethics-related language aimed at embattled EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt,
admonishing agency officials for using their positions for private gain or to perform personal duties.
The language won't become law, however. As a compromise, it was only included in the committee
report, not the actual text.
"While I would have preferred bill language, I think the report language we are including sends a strong
message," Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) said Thursday.
On the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said the measure touched on some
of the most contentious and partisan issues before Congress, including the Census, immigration policy
and gun regulation.
"But we have chosen to follow the direction of Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy: No
authorizing and no poison-pill riders," she said.

House GOP uses enviro riders to entice spending bill votes Back
By Anthony Adragna | 07/18/2018 05:02 AM EDT
House Republicans will vote this week to block several Obama-era environmental rules from EPA and
the Interior Department in an effort to round up votes for their annual spending bill for those agencies.
GOP lawmakers say that while they're satisfied with the pace of the Trump administration's deregulatory
efforts, they want to ensure their feelings are crystal clear and also think the amendments will shore up
their conservative right flank on the floor. Riders going after a host of familiar Obama-era environmental
targets, ranging from the tightened ozone standard to the Chesapeake Bay cleanup to Endangered Species
Act listings, were made in order to the pending "minibus" package, H.R. 6147 (115), which combines the
fiscal 2019 Interior-EPA, Financial Services and General Government spending bills.
"They help you on the floor in terms of attracting votes," Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior appropriator,
told reporters about the policy riders. "Even though the current administration is certainly very friendly in
this committee — and we've all been pleased how it's been run — it just makes it crystal clear at least the
direction Congress would like to go."
Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), who chairs the subcommittee that authored the Interior-EPA spending bill,
said the riders are an "insurance" policy to make sure the administration completes work on GOP
priorities like the rewrite of the Obama-era of the waters of the U.S. regulation.
"We're going through this [rollback] administratively but also we're laying down our marker as a
legislative branch," Calvert said.
Amendment debate began on the measure on Tuesday night with recorded amendment votes expected
Wednesday and a final vote on the package likely Thursday.
But the House approach may backfire when it's time to go to conference. Senate Appropriations
Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said it would "be more difficult" to finish appropriations work with
the inclusion of controversial policy riders.
"We've tried for the most part thus far to keep riders and authorizing legislation and poison pills,
whatever you want to call them, off these bills," he said. "That's what we'd like to stay with."
The two chambers are involved in a similar showdown over a separate minibus spending bill to fund the
Energy Department and several other agencies. The House included a rider blocking an Obama-era water
rule that the Senate rejected to keep its bill bipartisan. A conference committee on the bill, H.R. 5895
(115), was canceled last week amid a disagreement over a veterans’ health care program, and it remains
to be seen when the session will be rescheduled.
Both Republicans and Democrats acknowledged most of the policy riders wouldn't become law since
bills ultimately need 60 votes for passage in the Senate, but multiple House GOP lawmakers said they
thought adding them now would give their chamber a better hand going into negotiations to resolve their
differences with the Senate.
Democrats generally oppose the underlying House bill, and they said the fact Republicans feel the need to
add sweeteners means they can't even count on their own conference to pass it. And they said the move
to embrace controversial riders would imperil the chances of getting other appropriations packages
across the finish line.
"House Republicans must be worried about their ability to pass these bills on their own or else they
wouldn't violate their stated commitment to not allow controversial Floor votes," House Appropriations
Confidential API_00102557

ranking member Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. "We should be following the Senate and
producing bipartisan bills instead of including extreme poison pills to appease the right-wing of the
Republican Conference."
Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), ranking member on the Interior and Environment Appropriations
subcommittee, echoed that: "These toxic amendments, along with the 18 poison pill policy riders already
in the bill, are taking this bill from bad to worse."
Others said the effort showed a fundamental disrespect of the appropriations process.
"I'm a disciplined appropriator who believes we should not have authorizing language on an
appropriations bill," Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) told reporters. "It is a terrible way to legislate."
The House's approach stands in stark contrast to that in the Senate, which has steadfastly refused to
include the policy riders that have upended the appropriations process for a decade on its spending bills
this year.
That chamber passed its Interior-Environment bill out of the Appropriations Committee back in June
unanimously after following what Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chairman of the subcommittee
responsible for the bill, called "a common sense approach" to funding EPA. Senators also beat back an
attempt to add language repealing WOTUS to an earlier minibus in what Democrats called a positive
show of discipline needed to actually get appropriations bills signed into law.
Murkowski told POLITICO she'd taken "a pretty hard line on keeping our bill free from riders" and
suggested the House approach would make finishing their work more complicated.
"Will it make it more challenging? Yeah," she said. "But we're going to figure out a way."

Senate GOP leaders pitch four-bill domestic spending package Back
By Sarah Ferris | 07/17/2018 03:11 PM EDT
Senate GOP leaders are eyeing a floor vote next week on a spending package to fund an array of
domestic agencies, including agriculture, transportation and housing, a Republican familiar with the
plans said today.
GOP leaders are in talks to bring up a four-bill spending bundle that would include the Transportation-
HUD S. 3023 (115), Agriculture S. 2976 (115), Financial Services and Interior-Environment bills, the
individual said.
The four bills — which make up one-third of Congress' annual spending work —- amount to roughly
$154.1 billion. It would be the Senate's second vote on a spending package so far for fiscal 2019, and it
would bring those domestic agencies one step closer to avoiding a dreaded stopgap funding bill this fall.
The Senate was already slated to vote on the latter two bills, Financial Services and Interior-
Environment, next week. The House is voting on its own version of those bills, H.R. 6147 (115), this
week, and the Senate was planning to take up that package while substituting in its own bipartisan bills.
Now Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his deputies are also considering adding Transportation-

HUD and Agriculture.
The House has not yet passed the transportation or the agriculture bill, and would need to vote again on
the Senate's package, if it passes.

Critics: EPA science policy is out of tobacco playbook Back
By Emily Holden | 07/17/2018 05:57 PM EDT
Public health advocates opposing EPA's new science policy are seeking to frame it as a repeat of the
tobacco industry's discredited attacks on the research surrounding secondhand smoke.
Dozens of speakers from medical and environmental groups at a public hearing Tuesday said the
agency's proposal to bar science that doesn't have publicly available data would make it impossible or
incredibly expensive to conduct research that EPA would consider in writing regulations. They argued it
could also undermine study participants’ trust and have a chilling effect on what kind of science health
experts could pursue.
The result: EPA would begin to ignore critical information about how pollutants harm people, said the
rule's critics, who vastly outnumbered supporters.
"In short, we believe this policy is not in the best interest of our profession, the patients that we serve or
the public health," said Meredith McCormack, a physician-scientist with the American Thoracic Society.
"The focus on transparency is highly reminiscent of the rhetoric used by the tobacco players decades ago.
t
McCormack said tobacco industry documents showed companies trying to set up procedural hurdles for
what science the government could consider, and also used language similar to EPA's proposal around
transparency, sound science and reproducible science.
The change could weaken air quality standards in the near-term, as EPA reviews rules for ozone and
particulate matter, and could slow regulations long-term, said Paul Billings, senior vice president of
advocacy for the American Lung Association.
"If you didn't know that particulate matter led to premature death and EPA had not evaluated that science,
what would happen because of that?" Billings said outside the meeting room at agency headquarters.
"We could see a path where less information would then mean that you have weaker standards and
weaker cleanup."
Lipinski of Illinois — also appeared in opposition to the proposal.
Officials from Minnesota — John Stine from the Pollution Control Agency and Paul Allwood from the
Department of Health — asked EPA to immediately suspend the proposal.
Without studies on chemicals used at 3M manufacturing sites, the state wouldn't have been able to
successfully sue on behalf of affected residents, they said. Without research used in computer models for
pollution, they wouldn't know how many people in the Twin Cities die prematurely or are hospitalized
because of dirty air, they said.
Confidential API_00102559

Stine said after his statement that the state will seek a meeting with acting EPA Administrator Andrew
Wheeler.
The science rule was a priority for former Administrator Scott Pruitt, who promoted the proposal in
interviews with conservative media outlets, although its progress has already begun to slow, with EPA
reclassifying the regulation to require a greater level of internal review. Wheeler has said he will take a"
hard look" at the proposal, and some groups hope his biology background might prompt him to scrutinize
it more closely.
The draft rule's critics also maintained that peer review ensures that study data is valid, even if the data
itself is not publicly available.
Community-based health researchers argued that the rule might deter valuable science.
Pamela Miller, executive director of Alaska Community Action on Toxics, said the proposal would
prevent EPA from using her group's research on how toxic chemicals affect Arctic indigenous peoples.
"This information is considered protected information, medical information, because we're collecting
information about health, about demographics, about behaviors in the home and community," Miller
said. The group's research has been instrumental in informing how military operations are cleaned up, she
said.
The handful of the proposal's supporters who appeared at the meeting argued that for epidemiological
studies, researchers could make their data available while shielding the identities of participants.
Dan Byers, senior policy director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute, said
many of EPA's claimed monetary benefits from regulations are based on particulate matter studies that
didn't have public data.
Still, EPA's policy change could pose problems for businesses depending on how it is crafted.
The Chamber said it is "paramount" that EPA adhere to requirements to protect proprietary data and
confidential business information, as well as participant privacy. The group noted that Wheeler would
have special authority to exempt certain studies from the new requirement, and said EPA should develop
systematic guidance for how that would work.
The American Petroleum Institute said any data used in EPA policymaking should be transparent,
reproducible and publicly available "to the extent possible, and consistent with the protection of other
compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidentiality
protections."

EPA chief of staff: Agency aims to clear FOIA backlog in 'a few months' Back
By Eric Wolff | 07/17/2018 05:05 PM EDT
EPA hopes to clear a backlog of requests for records from the administrator's office "within the next few
months," agency chief of staff Ryan Jackson told POLITICO today.
Confidential API_00102560

The action follows an outcry over unanswered Freedom of Information Act requests that grew under
former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, leading watchdog groups and news organizations to file lawsuits
accusing the agency of flouting the law.
Now the agency has worked to streamline how it processes requests and is in the process of hiring six to
nine new staffers for its FOIA office, Jackson said in a phone interview. Jackson said the work was
already underway and was not a response to pressure, and he said the agency also faced a backlog dating
back to the George W. Bush administration.
"I believe that we have an organization in place now that will be able to response to these and get the
FOIA requests answered, get FOIA lawsuits settled and completed we hope," he said.
"What I mean is, 1) either entirely responded, or 2) be in the process of providing documents on a rolling
basis that the requester can expect on rely on," Jackson added.
EPA has seen jumps in both the number of requests and the number of lawsuits for failing to act quickly.
Rep. Elyah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, last week
demanded he be allowed to issue subpoenas due to abuses of FOIA.
In a response to Cummings sent Sunday, EPA principal deputy general counsel Kevin Minoli told
Cummings and Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy the agency had been working to clear up a long
backlog of requests, including deploying a special team to help an overwhelmed staff in the Office of
Administrator to deal with the increase.

White House confirms Trump meeting with Juncker next week Back
By Doug Palmer | 07/17/2018 01:29 PM EDT
President Donald Trump will host European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White
House next week for talks on a "wide range of priorities, including foreign and security policy,
counterterrorism, energy security and economic growth," the White House press office confirmed today.
The announcement of the visit on July 25 had been expected. It came one day after Trump returned from
a weeklong trip to Europe that began with a fractious summit with NATO allies and ended with a
surprisingly harmonious meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that left many observers
scratching their heads.
During an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump called the European Union "a foe" of the
United States — at least in an economic sense — along with other nations like China and Russia. Most
members of the NATO alliance are also members of the EU, aside from Canada, Norway, Iceland and
Turkey.
Trump has already imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports in the name of national security,
and is threatening to do the same on EU auto and auto part imports. Trump's metal duties prompted the
EU to respond in kind on U.S. agricultural and other exports.
Trump also routinely complains about the size of the U.S. goods trade deficit with the EU, which totaled
$151 billion last year. He seems less aware that the EU is the largest source of foreign investment in the

United States, totaling more than $2 trillion dollars at the end of 2016.

GAO: Less than half of U.S. schools test for lead in water Back
By Annie Snider | 07/17/2018 02:17 PM EDT
Fewer than half of American school districts test their drinking water for lead, and when they do, more
than a third find elevated levels of the potent neurotoxin, according to a government watchdog report
released today.
Larger school districts, and those in the Northeast, were far more likely to test for lead — and more likely
to find it — according to the Government Accountability Office report. The report, based on a survey of
more than 500 school districts across the country, found widely varying programs to test for and
remediate lead in drinking water.
There is no federal law requiring schools to test their drinking water for lead — in fact, a 1988 law
requiring states to establish such programs was struck down as unconstitutional. Even newer schools can
have lead in their systems because water fountains and other fixtures that contained up to 8 percent lead
could legally be called "lead free" until 2014.
The GAO report calls for EPA and the Department of Education to step up their efforts to inform schools
about the importance of testing for lead and the best ways to do so.
The six Democrats who requested the report, including top members of the House Energy and Commerce
and Senate HELP committees, called the report's findings "disturbing and unacceptable" in a joint
statement. They called on EPA to finalize a stronger regulation governing lead testing in drinking water
and to issue guidance requiring testing 1n all public schools.

Lawmakers urge EPA to consider update to PFAS health advisory Back
By Annie Snider | 07/17/2018 03:52 PM EDT
A bipartisan group of lawmakers 1s calling on the Trump administration to consider toughening its health
advisory for a pair of nonstick chemicals based on an HHS study that the administration sought to block.
Lawmakers, led by Michigan Reps. Fred Upton (R) and Dan Kildee (D), wrote to acting EPA
Administrator Andrew Wheeler today urging his agency to review the report from the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry, which set minimum risk levels for PFOA and PFOS seven to 10 times
lower than EPA's 2016 health advisory for the chemicals.
The lawmakers also called on Wheeler to adjust EPA's health advisory for those chemicals, if
appropriate, and to consider setting health advisory levels for additional PFAS chemicals that the report
looked at.
Confidential API_00102562

"The EPA should move quickly to make appropriate changes to the existing drinking water health
advisories that effectively communicate and explain risks to the public, as well as provide tools for
adequate protection from exposure to these chemicals," the lawmakers wrote.
Such a move could have major implications for the DoD, whose sites are a major source of PFAS
contamination. POLITICO reported in May that the Trump administration interfered with the ATSDR
report, calling it a "public relations nightmare," in part because of concerns from the DoD.
Former EPA Administrator Pruitt laid out a series of steps for addressing PFAS contamination, including
issuing toxicity values for two additional chemicals, a step short of issuing a health advisory.

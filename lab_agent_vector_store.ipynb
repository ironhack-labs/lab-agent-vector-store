You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

Larger rule set: Ruff implements over 800 rules, while Flake8 only implements around 200. This means that Ruff can catch more potential issues in your code.\\n\\n2. Better compatibility with other tools: Ruff is designed to work well with other tools like Black, isort, and type checkers like Mypy. This means that you can use Ruff alongside these tools to get more comprehensive feedback on your code.\\n\\n3. Automatic fixing of lint violations: Unlike Flake8, Ruff is capable of automatically fixing its own lint violations. This can save you time and effort when fixing issues in your code.\\n\\n4. Native implementation of popular Flake8 plugins: Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins natively, which means you don't have to install and configure multiple plugins to get the same functionality.\\n\\nOverall, Ruff offers a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience compared to Flake8, making it a popular choice for many developers.\"}"
